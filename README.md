GridGen is a command-line grid generation program which is designed to quickly setup logically-rectangular (or IJK ordered) finite volume/element meshes for three-dimensional stratigraphic models of pourous media subsurface aquifers. It is compatible with GwMove hydrogeological moddeling software and could be easily tweaked to adapt to input requirements by other community hydrogeological (or earth-siences) computer modelling codes.
